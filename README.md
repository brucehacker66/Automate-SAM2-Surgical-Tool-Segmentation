# Automate Surgical Tool Segmentation using SAM2

## Installation

SAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git && cd sam2

pip install -e .
```
If you are installing on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu.

To use the SAM 2 predictor and run the example notebooks, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` are required and can be installed by:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

Note:
1. It's recommended to create a new Python environment via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for this installation and install PyTorch 2.3.1 (or higher) via `pip` following https://pytorch.org/. If you have a PyTorch version lower than 2.3.1 in your current environment, the installation command above will try to upgrade it to the latest PyTorch version using `pip`.
2. The step above requires compiling a custom CUDA kernel with the `nvcc` compiler. If it isn't already available on your machine, please install the [CUDA toolkits](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) with a version that matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
3. If you see a message like `Failed to build the SAM 2 CUDA extension` during installation, you can ignore it and still use SAM 2 (some post-processing functionality may be limited, but it doesn't affect the results in most cases).

Please see [`INSTALL.md`](./INSTALL.md) for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.

## Getting Started

### Download Checkpoints (we use sam2 instead of sam2.1 checkpoints here)

First, we need to download a model checkpoint. All the model checkpoints can be downloaded by running:

```bash
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

or individually from:

- [sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt)
- [sam2.1_hiera_small.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_small.pt)
- [sam2.1_hiera_base_plus.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_base_plus.pt)
- [sam2.1_hiera_large.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt)

(note that these are the improved checkpoints denoted as SAM 2.1; see [Model Description](#model-description) for details.)

Then SAM 2 can be used in a few lines as follows for image and video prediction.
